# EE3 - Path Follower
**Overview**

An explanation of the project, how it was tested for functionality, and how successful it was can be read in [this PDF](https://github.com/inherentlyMalicious/EE3/blob/master/projectReport/PathFollowerReport.pdf).

**Goals**
> - Construct and wire a robot capable of following a black line using IR Sensors.
> - Write a PID-based function to intelligently adjust the PWM of motors.
> - [Bonus] Detect if a wheel's motion stops due to friction when powered at a low PWM and kickstart it if it does.

**Footage**
> - IR sensors detecting where the line is located: [link](https://github.com/inherentlyMalicious/EE3/blob/master/testFootage/TestFootage_Sensor.mp4)
> - Photomicrosensor detecting if a wheel stopped: [link](https://github.com/inherentlyMalicious/EE3/blob/master/testFootage/TestFootage_StopDetection.mp4)
> - Trial run of the overall system: [link](https://github.com/inherentlyMalicious/EE3/blob/master/testFootage/TestFootage_TrialRun.mp4)

> This project was contributed to by Brian Dionigi Raymond (il-dionigi) and Kevin Ke-En Sun (inherentlyMalicious) as part of EE3 during the Fall 2017 quarter at UCLA.
