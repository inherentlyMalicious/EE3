From there, we need to adjust the values to fit our known distribution and therefore simply map it as shown. By doing this, we see that our data better fits the distribution and is able to give us more valuable information to use with our PID function as the same change in the sensor reading returns a more significant change (and accurate) change in calculated distance from the line.\relax }}{5}}

The calculated distance for these areas is just the average value of the actual distance. Looking at this graph, the calculated distance is generally accurate to within less than half a centimeter. Most importantly, the graph slopes to a minimum from both sides, an important feature if a function is to be used for a PID controller.\relax }}{6}}
